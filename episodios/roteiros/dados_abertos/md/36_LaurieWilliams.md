(ADOLFO) Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of our podcast!

Today I have the pleasure of speaking with Laurie Williams.

She is a Distinguished University Professor at North Carolina State
University in Raleigh, USA.

Laurie is one of the two first winners, in 2009, of the [[ACM SIGSOFT
Influential Educator
Award]{.underline}](https://www.sigsoft.org/awards/influentialEducatorAward.html#:~:text=The%20SIGSOFT%20Influential%20Educator%20Award,%2C%20and%2For%20policy%20maker.),
for her "contributions to software engineering and computer science
education".

Laurie leads the **Software Engineering Realsearch research group** at
NC State, which I visited in 2014-15.

Laurie is a co-director of the **NSA Science of Security Lablet at NC
State**.

She was one of the founders of the first **XP/Agile conference**, *XP
Universe*, in 2001 in Raleigh which has now grown into the Agile annual
conference.

She has published many papers in Software Engineering and Software
Security as well as advised many PhD students.

She is also the lead author of the Pair Programming Illuminated book.

Thank you very much for having accepted my invitation, Laurie.

Would you like to add anything to this description of you and your
career?

(LAURIE)

**Software Security**

(ADOLFO) Laurie, you have been working with software security for a few
years. Can we trust most of the software we use every day?

(LAURIE)

(ADOLFO) What are some of the biggest challenges that software
developers face in this area?

(LAURIE)

(ADOLFO) How does your research help software developers address those
challenges?

(LAURIE)

(ADOLFO) What advice do you give to software engineers that want to
create secure software?

(LAURIE)

**Agile**

(ADOLFO) You co-wrote a book on Pair Programming, and you have also
written many papers related to Agile Software Development. In fact, 9
out of your 10 most cited works on Google Scholar are related to Agile.
How did you get interested in Agile Software Development?

(LAURIE)

**Women in Computer Science**

(ADOLFO) How did you get interested in Computer Science? How was your
education in the area?

(LAURIE)

(ADOLFO) Did you face difficulties at school or work because you are a
woman?

(LAURIE)

(ADOLFO) Do you participate in any support groups for women in
Computing?

(LAURIE)

(ADOLFO) What would you say to girls or women that want to follow a
career in Computing?

(LAURIE)

**Advising and Mentoring**

(ADOLFO) You have advised at least 20 PhDs, some of whom work in the
industry (Microsoft, SAS, IBM, Google), and some in academia. Did you
serve as a mentor for them in deciding what to do after graduation?

(LAURIE)

**Next Frontier**

(ADOLFO) For you, what is the next frontier in software engineering? (it
can be something that you think will happen or something you would like
to see happening in our field)

(LAURIE)

(ADOLFO) Thanks again for your time, Laurie.

Would you like to leave some final words for our audience?

(LAURIE)

(ADOLFO)

Thank you very much everyone, and see you on the next episode of our
podcast.
